# TiSliderMenu

This is a small Titanium Alloy widget to handle the Slide Menu like Facebook or many apps.

Is based on the [Alloy Slide Menu][1] example by Daniel Sefton, he offer both slide mode (left and right) and some functionality, I didn't need everything so I made a small version of the same widget.

Also I'm adding support to handle the navigation internaly in the widget so no need of extra elements or widgets to handle the open/close views

## Done
1. Slide to the right
4. Encapsulate all the slide logic inside of the widget
5. Use the widget in the Views or Controllers
6. Support open new views
7. Support the Back Button

## Doing
1. Assign Views to the Menu and Main views
2. Handle orientation changes
3. Full example with multiple windows and views

## Missing
1. Android specific, remove the back button
3. Support animations between views on iOS
4. Support touchStart and touchEnd
